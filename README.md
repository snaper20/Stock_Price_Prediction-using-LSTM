**Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**

---

### Introduction
This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM networks are powerful for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting, making them ideal for predicting stock prices.

### Features
- **LSTM Architecture**: Utilizes LSTM layers for capturing long-term dependencies in the data.
- **Sequential Model**: Implements a sequential model for easy construction and training.
- **Mean Squared Error Loss**: Minimizes the mean squared error loss function for training.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Employs the Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.

### Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. **Dataset**: Prepare your stock price dataset. Ensure it's in the appropriate format for training the LSTM model.

### Usage
1. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model using the provided dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
2. **Prediction**: Run the prediction script to generate predictions.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

### Results
- View the training and validation loss curves to assess model performance.
- Visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices using the provided plotting script.
